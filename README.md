### Foundation is a library for bootstrapping Minecraft plugins.
[![](https://jitpack.io/v/kangarko/Foundation.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#kangarko/Foundation)

Thousands of servers are running on Foundation since 2013. It has been battle tested and proven in plugins ChatControl, Boss, CoreArena, Confiscate, AutoPlay, Puncher, Winter, AnimeX and others.

Foundation has never been publicly released before MineAcademy. We decided to release its sources to the public and teach it to enable people develop plugins faster, saving boilerplate code and thus focus on what matters the most, putting their ideas out there.
